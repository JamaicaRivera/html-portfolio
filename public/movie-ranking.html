<h1>The Best Movies According to Jamaica Rivera</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Dayo</h3>
<p>
    It is a FIlipino animated movie. I like it a lot.
    It reminds me of my childhood which is the best part
    of it. 
</p>
<h3>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</h3>
<p>
    This is one of my favorite movie. The protagonist
    is a loner and unable to speak his heart.
</p>
<h3>The Best of Me</h3>
<p>
   I love the actors in this movie. The settings is very
   beautiful. I love how the story turns around all the time.
